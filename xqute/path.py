"""Provides the SpecPath and MountedPath classes.

It is used to represent paths of jobs and it is useful when a job is running in a
remote system (a VM, a container, etc.), where we need to mount the paths into
the remote system (MountedPath).

But in the system where this framework is running, we need to use the paths
(specified directly) that are used in the framework, where we also need to carry
the information of the mounted path (SpecPath).

The module provides two main abstract base classes:
- `MountedPath`: Represents a path as it appears in the remote execution environment.
- `SpecPath`: Represents a path as it appears in the local environment where the
framework runs.

Both classes have implementations for local paths and various cloud storage paths,
including:
- Google Cloud Storage
- Azure Blob Storage
- Amazon S3

These classes maintain the relationship between the local and remote path
representations, allowing transparent path operations while preserving both path
contexts.
